# Everything is javax.persistence.FetchType.EAGER because it will definitely work that way in code; for efficiency, can optimize later by removing eager fetch type.
# Many of the annotations are not needed as they are the default behavior. They are added anyway to facilitate changing the values from defaults if desired.
